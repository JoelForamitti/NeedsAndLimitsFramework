# A framework for agent-based models of human needs and ecological limits

The Needs & Limits (N&L) framework is a theoretical and computational foundation for agent-based models (ABMs) aimed at addressing multiple dimensions of human well-being and environmental impacts.

**Abstract**

> The social and ecological challenges of our time require a better understanding of the complex interactions between the multiple dimensions of human well-being and environmental impacts. This article introduces the Needs and Limits (N&L) framework, a theoretical and computational foundation for agent-based simulations of heterogeneous individuals who try to increase their quality of life through the satisfaction of human needs. Based on psychological research, human needs are described as satiable, adaptive, and interdependent with the social and bio-physical environment. The N&L framework represents a generic foundation that can be applied to a broad range of socio-economic and ecological scenarios. A comparison is provided with classical utility approaches. The framework is illustrated for the topics of income inequality and climate policy.

**Usage**

To use the framework on your computer, you need a working installation of Python 3.8 or higher with the packages given in `requirements.txt`. Then clone this repository and open `overview.ipynb` or `TimeIncomeScenario/TimeIncomeScenario.ipynb` to get started. For more information on how to use Jupyter Notebooks, see https://jupyter.org/. 

You can also run the framework directly in your browser using binder: https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/JoelForamitti/NeedsAndLimitsFramework/HEAD

**Documentation**

All classes and functions are documented within the code in `NeedsLimitsFramework`. The application examples presented in Foramitti (2022) can be found in `TimeIncomeScenario`.
